# Federated Categories

All the portals in the federation now use a unified general disciplines vocabulary –the UNESCO Thesaurus– to describe each portal categories. This allows for an easier comparison of the disciplines covered by each portal and enables the filtering of ontologies by categories in multiple views of the semantic artefact catalogues.
Consequently, each portal have changed all its categories to follow this shared approach. In AgroPortal, for instance, we have picked up 41 categories (organized as top categories and sub categories) from the UNESCO Thesaurus and 1 from AGROVOC. These categories are shown in multiple views in the portals with “shortnames” and are mostly used to: (i) assign categories when editing on ontology; (ii) select ontologies in Browse page or Advanced ontology selector.

Each portal have re-assigned every ontologies or vocabularies to those categories / disciplines. This work has been done mostly manually and is currently being curated, but we suggest ontology developers to double check if the new categories assigned to their resource are appropriate and/or if any other ones are missing.
